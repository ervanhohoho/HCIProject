					What is DMD?
				</div>
				Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) affects about 300,000 boys worldwide, with approximately 20,000 cases in the United States.

				DMD is a form of muscular dystrophy that is caused by a mutation of the dystrophin gene-located on the X chromosome-which codes for the protein dystrophin. The absence of dystrophin in the body causes muscles to deteriorate and break down. DMD is the most frequently occurring and one of the most rapidly progressive childhood neuromuscular disorders. Due to the way DMD is inherited, boys are primarily affected.

				In Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, the child's exons (sections of DNA that code for the protein dystrophin) are deleted, duplicated, or cause an abrupt stop in the protein production process. The impaired exons then interfere with the rest of the gene being pieced together, which results in a mutation that causes the body to lack the protein needed to protect and rebuild muscle fibers. This leads to continuous muscle degeneration and premature death. Read more about DMD on duchenne,com

				DMD has many variations, which makes finding a cure extremely challenging. JAR of Hope's mission is dedicated to bringing awareness and raising funds directed to finding a cure.
